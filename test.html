      I'm happy to be here with you today.

      One of the things I really enjoy about coding is <strong>the feeling of creating something</strong> by just using HTML and CSS.

      One of the things I find difficult about web development is <i>how easy it is to mess up </i> by typing and HTML element incorrectly.
